# Coding Challenge - Data Engineer

This repository was created to host the challenge for Data Engineer roles at
Chance.

# Evaluation

This is a non-exaustive list of the aspects that we will consider:

* Code organization
* Problem solving
* Code readability
* Chosen solutions
* Version control practices

# Problem - News scraping

You will have to create a working prototype that scrapes some news articles (preferably from your home country), cleanse the data, save them into disk (files, db, ...) and provides an api to access the articles.

## Details

For this task you can use any language of your choice, but we recommend the use
of some of the following: python, jupyter, BeautifulSoup. You will have
to :
* Write an application that gets (at least) a few dozen articles of a news website (if you are familiar, you can crawl it with a framework like scrapy)
* Cleanse the data to get only relevant information (you can use a framework as
    readability)
* Store the data on disk, in the format you prefer (file, database, etc)
* Write a method to get the relevant articles from the stored data, when given as input a keyword.

# Usage

1. Start a git repository with ```git init```
1. Do your magic on your local machine, trying to commit often
1. Add at the end of this README a small descriptions about your choices.
1. Run ```git bundle create YOURNAME.bundle HEAD ```
1. Send the generated file by email to tech-interview@chance.co
